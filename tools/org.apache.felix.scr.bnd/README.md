# Apache Felix SCR BND Plugin

> **Note** This project is deprecated as it is superceeded by the usage of the official OSGi annotations together with the maven-bundle-plugin or the bnd-maven-plugin. 

This plugin processes the Apache Felix SCR annotations and creates XML descriptor files for OSGi Declarative services. The SCR annotations only support the features of OSGi R5 Declarative Services, but not newer features like constructor or field injection.
