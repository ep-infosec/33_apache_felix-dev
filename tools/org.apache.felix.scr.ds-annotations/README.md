# Apache Felix SCR DS Annotations

> **Note** This project is deprecated as it is superceeded by the usage of the official OSGi annotations together with the maven-bundle-plugin or the bnd-maven-plugin. 

The SCR annotations only support the features of OSGi R5 Declarative Services, but not newer features like constructor or field injection.
